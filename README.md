# Artificial-Intelligence-Assignment
A Java console application that uses simulated annealing to break a playfair cipher. Fourth Year, Artificial Intelligence, Software Development.

**IMPORTANT: working temperature and transition controls for** ```ciphertext-2018.txt``` **are _20_ and _50,000_.**

## Requirements

+ A menu-driven command line UI.
+ User specified cipher text source.
+ User specified plain text destination.
+ A simulated annealing algorithm to break a Playfair Cipher, using a log-probability
and *n*-gram statistics as a heuristic evaluation function.
+ The package name **ie.gmit.sw.ai** must be used.
+ Must be completed and submitted by the *8th of April 2018*.

## Additional Features

+ ~~Calculation suggestion.~~ Not accurate for this version of the S.A. Playfair algorithm.
+ ~~Optimized to end when satisfied with key.~~ Any optimizations I considered were fairly hacky. I decided to fully iterate through the loops to heighten the chance of getting the ciphertext decrypted correctly, at the expense of not reducing the time of the loops.
+ Input and file validation - adding to the robustness of the application.
+ Object Oriented Design ([UML](#uml-diagram)):
  + Cipher breaker factory.
  + Amply abstracted.
